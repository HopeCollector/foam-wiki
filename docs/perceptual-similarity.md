## Brief Introduction

![](./assets/2020-09-08-21-27-34.png)

The paper argues that widely used image quality metrics like SSIM and PSNR mentioned in [[image-quality-assessment]] are _simple and shallow_ functions that may fail to account for many nuances of human perception. The paper introduces a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgements to systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics.

Findings of this paper suggests that _perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations._
