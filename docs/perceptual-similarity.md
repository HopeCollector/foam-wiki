## Brief Introduction

![](./assets/2020-09-08-21-27-34.png)

The paper argues that widely used image quality metrics like SSIM and PSNR mentioned in [[iqa]] are *simple and shallow* functions that may fail to account for many nuances of human perception. The paper introduces a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgements to systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics.

Findings of this paper suggests that *perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.*
