# The CW attack algorithm

> The Carlini & Wagner attack is currently one of the best known algorithms to generate adversarial examples.

```js
import a from 'b'

console.log(123, 123, 'abc')
const c = () => {
  return 1 + 2
}
```

## The CW attack

Can be integrated with many other loss functions like the SSIM, PSNR mentioned in [[iqa]].
